# Details

Investigative Case Management for Integrated Water Management. Developer Tools to manage and monitor drones, UAVS for cost effective monitoring of water supply chain units at sewage treatment plants and at larger water sources like dams, rivers and forest lakes in a variety of topographic regions. 


Our platform solution offers an Artificial Intelligence-based object detection system that utilizes NFT.Storage, IPFS and Axelar powered solutions with BNB audit contracts and Fantom destination chain for sorting information obtained from a variety of drone cameras deployed at monitoring spots.

How it works:

Camera Management: Add/edit/delete cameras with a front end application with NFT.Storage (IPFS/Filecoin)  

Object Detection using open source solutions and Pytorch/Tensorflow deep learning library using CNN neural networks.

Video analytics configuration using NFT.Storage for data retrieval.

Live streaming with Object Detection Video Analytics using open source solutions for streaming, Litprotocol for security and NFT.Storage for snapshots.

Alarm storage using Ethereum. Save/delete alarm metadata and image to/from IPFS using NFT.Storage. Store the hash returned from IPFS to Ethereum test network using NFT.Storage. Provide links to alarms and blockchain transaction details.Alarm Viewer: Add alarms with a single touch. Open the Alarm Settings menu from the home page. Add an alarm, set the wallpaper or choose an alarm tone. You can also delete an existing alarm

Crowdsourcing information sharing for better and cleaner drinking water, Remote Water Monitoring, Recyclability of Water.

Features:

Our project focuses on effective design, engineering and delivery of solution for detecting & managing UAVs & Drones and setting up geo fences using predictive analytics and blockchain. 

•Detection : Identifying the drones & UAVs in the video feed using object detection.

•Discovery : Logging the identities of the drones & UAVs flying in a particular air space at any instant of time, using exchange of unique identifiers.

•Geo-fencing : Discovering unlawful presence and raising alarms using the detection & discovery data.

•Monitoring : Looking out and reporting incidents based on event detection in visual data.

•Analysis : Analyzing route patterns and incidents.

•Drone Incident Reporting : Publish drone incident reports, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application over the Ethereum blockchain network and Embark Tools.

A more safe & regulated local air traffic of drones & UAVs with availability of movement data and prediction of future of conditions. Drone incident reporting, preventive measures and remediation using a decentralized twitter application.
